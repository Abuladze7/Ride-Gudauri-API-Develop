    "question": "When is the best time to fly?",
    "answer": "You can fly practically at any time of the day or year. In the morning the air is calmer and there are no turbulences disturbing the flight. In the afternoon - especially in summer - it can become a bit more thermally active, but this often allows us to ascend. If this becomes too uncomfortable for a passenger, one can easily leave this upwind and steer in the opposite direction to the landing site. Even in winter you can fly super tandem. The air here is usually very calm.",

    "question": "Do I have to be athletic to fly?",
    "answer": "A certain level of sporting fitness is of course an advantage, but not absolutely necessary. You still have to be able to walk. Often we have to walk 5-15 minutes to the actual starting place.\nDiseases such as high blood pressure, circulatory disorders, heart complaints, etc. must be reported when ordering.",

    "question": "Which weather is suitable to fly?",
    "answer": "We fly all year round (even in winter), but only in conditions that allow safe flight. The sun does not have to shine necessarily and also with cloudy sky one flies. The wind must not be too strong and must come from the right direction. Our tandem pilots know when to fly and when not. However, weather conditions can lead to changes in dates or flight locations and, if necessary, to cancellations at short notice.",

    "question": "Can I trust your tandem pilots and fly with a clear conscience?",
    "answer": "Our tandem pilots have a lot of experience in both solo and tandem flying. We fly very often and under different flight conditions. In addition, we all come from our flight area and know the conditions of the Bernese Oberland.\nSafety is our top priority, we do not compromise and therefore sometimes make unpopular decisions, i.e. we also cancel flights when safety is in question.",

    "question": "What do I have to do at the start?",
    "answer": "Your tandem pilot will give you a detailed briefing before the start and do a test run. It is very important when starting that you do not sit down as a passenger, but run along until the pilot says that you can now take a seat in the harness.",
